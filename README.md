# RazorTags
A library of Razor tag helpers for ASP.NET Core, styled upon Bootstrap 4.

This library is a refoundation of the [Bootstrap.MVC library](https://github.com/copernicus365/Bootstrap.MVC) on top of ASP.NET Core (instead of ASP.NET MVC 5), with its new and beautiful razor HTML tags, and on top of Bootstrap 4 (instead of Bootstrap 2.3!).
